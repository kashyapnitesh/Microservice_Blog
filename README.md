# Project Title: Microservices-Based Blog Application with Post and Comment Features

### Project Overview:
This project represents a robust microservices-based blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, as well as post comments. The application is built using a microservices architecture, incorporates Eureka registry services, and leverages an API gateway for efficient communication between services. This project aims to provide a scalable and maintainable solution for developing a feature-rich blog platform.


## Features:
**1. Microservices Architecture:** The application is built as a set of microservices, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Each microservice is responsible for specific functionality, enhancing modularity and independence.

**2. Post Management:**
- Create Post: Users can create new blog posts, including text, images, and metadata.
- Get Post: Retrieve and view posts created by users.
- Update Post: Edit and modify existing blog posts.
- Delete Post: Remove unwanted posts.

**3. Comment System:**
- Comment on Posts: Users can comment on blog posts, fostering interaction and discussion.
- Update Comment: Edit and refine their comments.
- Delete Comment: Remove comments as needed.
  
**4 Eureka Registry Services:** Eureka is used as a service registry for managing microservices and facilitating service discovery. This ensures that all microservices can dynamically find and communicate with each other.

**5. API Gateway:** An API gateway is implemented to handle client requests, route them to the appropriate microservices, and provide load balancing and security features. This ensures a unified and efficient communication channel for the application.


## Technology Stack:
- **Spring Boot**
- **Eureka services**
- **MySQL**
- **Postman**


## Getting Started:
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local development environment.
2. Set up and configure the Eureka registry service for microservices registration and discovery.
3. Deploy individual microservices, including post management and the comment system.
4. Configure the API gateway (Zuul) to route requests.
5. Create a frontend user interface to interact with the microservices via API calls.
6. Customize the application as needed, including database setup, user authentication, and styling.
7. Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance.
8. Deploy the application to a production environment.
